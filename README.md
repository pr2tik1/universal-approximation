# Neural Network and their approximation ablities

This project is based upon approximation theorem of neural network known as Universal approximation Theorem, which states that,<br>
"The universal approximation theorem, in one of its most general versions, says that if we consider only continuous activation functions σ, then a standard feedforward neural network with one hidden layer is able to approximate any continuous multivariate function f to any given approximation threshold ε, if and only if σ is non-polynomial"<br>

The notion is, Neural Networks are function approximation machines that achieve generalization statistically.<br>

I have taken basic functions such as cosine and sine,<br>
